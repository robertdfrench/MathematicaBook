\chapter*{If you have never programmed before\ldots}
\label{chap:Prelim}

This pamphlet assumes you have done at least a little programming before, possibly in C, C++, FORTRAN, Visual Basic, or some other language. If not, \emph{that is completely fine}. We will walk you through a little basic programming here so that you can get your feet wet, and then you will be ready to take on chapter 1!
